\subsection{BASTL}

BASTL Kastle, two iterations and a spinoff: Kastle, Kastle v1.5, Kastle Drum. 

Based on Arduino, GitHub repository with alternate firmware.

Breadboard patching with jumper cables, inputs and outputs robust enough to allow for mistakes in connections.

Organelle computer for sound, scriptable, Linux operating system + Pure Data software.

ETC and EYESY computers for visuals, scriptable, Linux operating system + Python / pygame environment or openFrameworks.

\subsection{monome}

Aleph: sound computer

Norns: sound computer, currently on its second iteration, with expanded hard drive. Also there is a DIY versionm which is cheaper and runs on a Raspberry Pi.
