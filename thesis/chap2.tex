\subsection{BASTL}

BASTL Kastle, two iterations and a spinoff: Kastle, Kastle v1.5, Kastle Drum. 

Based on Arduino, GitHub repository with alternate firmware.

Breadboard patching with jumper cables, inputs and outputs robust enough to allow for mistakes in connections.

\subsection{Critter \& Guitari}

Organelle computer for sound, scriptable, Linux operating system + Pure Data software.

ETC and EYESY computers for visuals, scriptable, Linux operating system + Python / pygame environment or openFrameworks.

\subsection{monome}

Aleph: sound computer

Norns: sound computer, currently on its second iteration, with expanded hard drive. Also there is a DIY versionm which is cheaper and runs on a Raspberry Pi.
Norns is a Linux machine, running SuperCollider for the sound engine, and Lua scripts.

\subsection{Shbobo}

Peter Blasser's Shbobo

Shnth and Shtar

Shlisp language and Fish IDE.
