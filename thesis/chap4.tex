\chapter{Tiny trainable instruments}

\section{Design principles}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Cheap
  \item Privacy
\end{enumerate}

\section{Technology}

Arduino microcontoller

Arduino library KNN

TensorFlow Lite Micro

\section{Programmable / remix}

\section{Philosophy and experience}

\section{Inputs}

Enumerate sensors from the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense

\section{Outputs}

The different outputs were picked, because of their low cost, ubiquity, and possibilities of expansion and combining them.

\subsection{Buzzer}

\subsection{Servo motor}

\subsection{MIDI}

We wrote functionalities to manipulate MIDI innstruments, and included examples to interface with some popular and cheap MIDI instruments, such as the Korg volca beats.


\subsection{Thermal printer}



\section{Development}

Team with Peter Tone and Maxwell Wang.

We have a shared Google Drive folder, where we all share notes about our research and development of the library and the educational material.

Peter has done research on code and data structures.

Maxwell researches ways of teaching our topics, and has been documenting and writing the documentation and tutorials.
