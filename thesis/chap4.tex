\section{Development}

Team with Peter Tone and Maxwell Wang.

We have a shared Google Drive folder, where we all share notes about our research and development of the library and the educational material.

Peter has done research on code and data structures.

Maxwell researches ways of teaching our topics, and has been documenting and writing the documentation and tutorials.
