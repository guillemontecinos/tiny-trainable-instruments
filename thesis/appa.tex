During this thesis I had this particular context:

\section{Language}

My native language is Spanish, and this thesis was written in English.

\section{Social}

This thesis was written during the COVID19 pandemic, during the longest stretch I have had of not visiting my home country Chile, or leaving USA and its east coast, and not working on a shared office, or living with roommates, or seeing family, limiting my physical interactions to mostly a handful of friends and toi the internet.

\section{Location}

Written in Boston, Massachusetts and New York City, between November 2020 and July 2021.

\section{Open source software}

This thesis document was written using LaTeX, using Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

The TinyTrainable library was written in C++, and packaged as an Arduino library, relying on open source dependencies by Arduino, Adafruit, and Google.

The auxiliary code is a mix of Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, and shell scripts.

The documentation was written using Markdown.

Everything was written on a 2017 Macbook Air 13-inch, running macOS Catalina.
