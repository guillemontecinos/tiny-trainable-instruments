# Wiring


For the construction of a Tiny Trainable Instrument, we will be using breadboards.

## Inputs

In terms of input, we will be using the included sensors on the Arduino microcontroller.


## Outputs

In terms of output, here are some of the configurations we will use, sorted from simpler and cheap to complex and expensive.

### USB output

We can output data over the USB cable, using the serial port.

This output can range from debugging information, to data for controlling software. In this repository we include some open source audiovisual scripts and examples that you can expand on.

### Internal LED output

The Arduino has lights that we can use for debugging and output purposes.

### External LED output


### MIDI DIN output

We can use the MIDI protocol, and a MIDI DIN connector to output information over the MIDI protocol.
