# Jupyter

## Overview

Jupyter is a free, open-source browser application that allows users to easily read and write code in a clean, accessible environment. Code is segmented into cells, which users can execute individually by clicking into and selecting the triangle "play" button at the top. Subsequent code executes based on operations done in previous cells. Basically, Jupyter notebooks allow programmers to create clean, step-by-step interactive walkthroughs through their code.
